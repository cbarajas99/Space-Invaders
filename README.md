# Space-Invaders (2017)
A simple version of Space Invaders using Python 2. In terms of what is completed, I tested that the user is able to move horizontally, and I have made it so that the user isn’t going to go off the screen. Therefore, when its x coordinate reaches a certain coordinate, it stays still until the player moves the user in the opposite direction. I have also made it when the player presses the space bar the bullet is drawn. I have also made it that when an enemy move to the “end of the screen” that it just moves down and starts going right if it was previously going left and vice versa. I have also made it that when the bullet and enemy collide, they will both be removed. I wanted to do more in terms of adding sound effects whenever the bullet is fired, and whenever an enemy and bullet collide, but it didn’t end out working out. Also, I added a score board, and a background picture to the game. Before getting to where I am with my progress, I think I was making the process more difficult for myself because I was overthinking how certain things should be done.I am not that impressed with the fact that sometimes my enemy and bullet collision code will sometimes not work even though I increased the units from 10 to 25.
